                    <p>Hello!  I'm an extremely driven and creative Full Stack Developer who is currently open for career opportunities as a front-end or back-end web developer in the Greater Seattle Area.</p>
                    <p>I'm a recent graduate of Coding Dojo, a coding school located in Bellevue, WA that teaches three full stacks in three months.  I'm capable of learning new technologies very quickly, and I am always looking for opportunities to further expand my skills and grow as a developer.</p>
